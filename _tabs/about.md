# Hi, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist with expertise in AI/ML, statistical modeling, and healthcare analytics. With a background spanning transport policy analysis and healthcare innovation, I bring a unique perspective to solving complex problems with data-driven solutions.

Currently, I lead technical initiatives in AI/ML applications at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, focusing on clinical prediction models, NLP solutions, and production-ready healthcare applications. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Beyond Data & AI
- ðŸ“¸ **Photography** â€“ Capturing quiet corners of **Japan's countryside** when I'm not coding.
- â˜• **CafÃ© Explorer** â€“ Always on the lookout for great coffee and pastries (I love cinnamon rolls).
- ðŸŽµ **Music Enthusiast** â€“ Attempting to learn **piano** (work in progress!).
